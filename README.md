## Project Euler Solutions

This project contains solutions to several Euler problems. *Project Euler* (pronounced 'Oiler' for reasons arcane) provides a list of mathematical/computer programming problems, which allow programmers to develop both their reasoning and programming skills. For those new to programming, these problems can be a fun and challenging way to learn. I would highly recommend attempting to solve these problems on your own before looking at my solutions.

The solutions are written in Java. Each java file may be run independently. To do so:
1. Download the .java file you want to run.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the .java file was downloaded.
3. Compile the program using the Java Compiler.
4. Run the program with the command 'java <filename>', without the '.java' extension this time.

The program will run, and then you should see a message with the program's result.

I hope you find these solutions useful!
